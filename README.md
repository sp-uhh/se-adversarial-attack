Paper (arXiv): https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21087

This repository accompanies our work showing that modern speech enhancement (SE) models can be steered by tiny, psychoacoustically masked perturbations added *before* enhancement. We compare predictive SE (direct mapping, complex ratio masking) with diffusion-based SE, and study how sampling stochasticity and design choices affect robustness.
